# Why would you need ONCE
Start any software by draging it onto any device. Just like on the bride of Star Terk Vessel Enterprise form TNG.
And if you do not want to wait for that star time...clone this Git repo once now.
# What is ONCE
once.ts ist the Typescript implementaion of the first ever machine to machine kernel, that runs in any browser and everywhere you can access JavaScript. it works on node, deno and even exists in some more native languages soon.
ONCE means "Object Network Communication Engine" and enables distributed objects to communicate between any device with an internet access and even move freely from device to device.

# Steps to start
git clone https://github.com/Cerulean-Circle-GmbH/once.ts.git
cd once-ts
npm i
npm run tunnel

This command will start a local express server on your local machine and open a personal tunnel so that you can access it from all over the world.
