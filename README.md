# Why would you need ONCE
Start any software by draging it onto any device. Just like on the bride of Star Terk Vessel Entrprise form TNG.
And if you do not want to wait for that star time...clone ths Git repo once now.
# What is ONCE
once.ts ist the Typescript implementaion of the first ever machine to machine kernel, that runs in any browser and everywhere you can access JavaScript. it works on node, deno and even exists in some more native languages soon.
ONCE means "Object Network Communication Engine" and enables distributed objects to communicate between any device with an internet access and even move freely from device to device.
